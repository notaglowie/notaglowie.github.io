        <h2>Falka Warren</h2>
        <p>Hello there! I'm Falka, a 17 year old student developer from Southern Europe, I enjoy breaking and (re)building stuff from scratch purely to figure out how the world around me works.<br><br>I have experience working on Telegram and Discord bots, offensive security, Windows & Linux implant development, OSINT, embedded systems and robotics.<br><br>I also self-host most of my personal projects and services that I use daily (which explains the rather empty GitHub) and as such I have experience being a sysadmin and working with Docker</p>
